# neural-network-challenge-2

In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a neural network that HR can use to predict whether employees are likely to leave the company. Additionally, HR believes that some employees may be better suited to other departments, so I was also asked to predict the department that best fits each employee. These two columns should be predicted using a branched neural network.
